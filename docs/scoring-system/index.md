## About the Criteria
Each of the themes will be judged on the following criteria:

- Dark/Light mode support
    - Whether there is a supported colour scheme provided by the theme for light/dark mode or both

- One or multiple colour schemes
    - Whether the theme bundles one colour scheme for light/dark mode, both light and dark more, or multiple colour schemes for light and dark mode

- Value propositions 
    - What the theme does different from others

- Aesthetics (**subjective metric**)
    - Is the theme aesthetically pleasing? Does it have a clean UI? Is the colour palette nice on the eyes?

- Accessibility
    - Was the theme built with accessibility in mind? Are there any options to configure stuff like contrast and font size?

- Style Settings support
    - Does the theme add customisation options via Style Settings?

- Age of the theme 
    - Older themes are expected to be more mature and stable

- Last Updated
    - Is this theme actively maintained? When was it last updated?


### About the difficulty of the scoring system
The scoring system was made so that the themes with the higher scores are as close to almost objectively perfect as possible, other than aesthetic preferences.

For reference, take a look at [the scoring example](#scoring-example) provided.
