## Excerpt from README

A retro-future 80s inspired theme for Obsidian, compatible with Obsidian V0.5.0.

## Features

There's a bonus animation, commented out by default in the CSS file.  
Uncomment it and you get an old-school CRT effect with a chunky pixel pentile look, flickering screen and blurring text.
