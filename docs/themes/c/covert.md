## Excerpt from README
When you're in a coffeehouse or library, or just in public, but you want to work in Obsidian, this theme is exactly what you need if you want to write with some level of privacy. 

Keep in mind that this doesn't fully hide your text, but makes it a lot harder to see for the nosey person sitting at that table behind you. Also, as this is just a theme using CSS to make the dark style, let me make it clear that there is no type of encryption on your files, or any other mechanism to keep your data secret should someone else have access to the device Obsidian is running on.

That being said, enjoy writing in a more covert fashion!

Built off of the Obsidian Nord theme by Insanum. Thank you!
