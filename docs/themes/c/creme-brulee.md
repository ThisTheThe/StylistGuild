## Excerpt from README

This theme was designed to look minimalistic, but cozy,
with soft colors and many little adjustments.

## Features

This theme changes some of the standard markdown formatting's appearance, so you
can add colors to your notes without using html. I tried to do this without
breaking semantic meanings of the tags. Just remember this colors will only appear
in Obsidian, and will not be preserved if you want to export your notes.

This theme contains some cssclasses that allow you to hide some elements from
the specific notes while keeping them in the others. Just add one of these
values to your cssclasses property:

- hide-inline-title
- hide-backlinks
- hide-properties
