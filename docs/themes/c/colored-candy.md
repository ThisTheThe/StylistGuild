## Excerpt from README
This is a cute lil' theme for Obsidian that changes the interface colors based off of your chosen accent color.

> You can choose your accent color in Obsidian under Settings → Appearance → Accent color.

This theme will change the background colors according to your accent color's hue, and create two new psuedo accent colors with their hues offset from the original, and calculating their saturation and lightness from the original.

This theme has a few configurable options accessible through the Style Settings plugin.

## Features
- Background-to-text contrast: The background lightness and saturation will be adjusted by this amount to give more contast to the text.
- Readable line length: The maximum line length when "Readable line length" is enabled.
> None: Readable line length can be enabled under Settings → Editor → Readable line length.
