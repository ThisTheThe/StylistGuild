## Excerpt from README

Arcane, a lightweight and mobile-friendly refresh of my legacy Obsidian theme Dracula \+ LYT

## Features

“The Arcane theme was initially designed as a base16 theme, utilizing a 16-colour palette composed of 8 shades and 8 accents. The beauty of this approach is its flexibility and simplicity. Want a new theme every week or month? Simply replace the main 8 colour variables in the .css file. Whether you're aiming for the aesthetics of DOOM EMACS, DARK ONE, ATOM, or NORD, all it takes is a change of 8 colours. No more fiddling with complex colour schemes\!

However, everything changed when I came across `#88c0d4`, a soft, muted cyan that I absolutely adore. Every time I open my vault, this colour palette evokes feelings of clarity, calmness, and freshness. It is the colour which had to stay and the rest of the accents simply followed.

This Theme doesn't rely on 16 colours anymore. But the idea of the `base16` framework is still there.”
