## Excerpt from README
Elegant, minimalist dark theme.  

No app borders, images with rounded corners, styled links, fancy headings in reading mode.

Due to editor styling, should be always used with a left sidebar, otherwise you'll have the file contents on the far left border of the screen.

## Features
Narrow editor in reading mode (550px).
