## Excerpt from README
A glowing retro-futurist terminal inspired theme for Obsidian

Autotape is a minimal Obsidian theme designed to invoke the feeling of old-style terminal interfaces without looking dated. Designed for Dark Mode, but compatible with either.

## Features
Autotape is fully compatible with the accent colour system. Simply select the colour you'd like in the Appearance section of Obsidian options and watch the theme change!
